          Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Yeah. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Ahh. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.

            <h3>Connection</h3>
            <p>
              One of the main tools for connecting me, my work and customers is Git. Git is a free, open source version control system. This system makes the world of websites a lot easier to deploy with multiple options like Netlify.

            <h3>Websites</h3>
            <p>
              My goal is to create, update, maintain websites that are responsive, intuitive, and creative. I have worked with entreprenuers and small business all of my life. I know how hard it is to keep all the balls in the air and growing. I want to help make life better by make a website that conveys your brand and customers remember.

            <h3>Code</h3>
            <p>
              My new favorite obsession! I love learning how to make things work and look good together. Right now I am mostly into the frontend parts of code but once I feel ready, HA!, I will venture into the backend realm of code.
            </p>
            <p>I currently have knowledge with HTML5, CSS, JS, React. I have been working with GatsbyJS framework and use Netlify to help my clients have great Jamstack Websites.</p>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
              Music is a very important part of my life. I go to sleep and wake up to music. What kind of music do I listen to, you may wonder. My taste is always expanding, part of what I love about todays music platforms. So easy to explore and find new artists. I love some old school twangy Country, but there is also Rock and Pop. My favorite is Singer/Songwriter, which encompasses most of my favorite artists. Americana is great to have flowing when I need some inspiration.

              If you know me than you know that my world pretty much revolves around Ollie. He is such a great pup and very understanding of my bad singing, messy housekeeping, schedule. All he asks is for lots of walks, social time, good food and all the belly rubs! Check out his site here: <br />

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              My next goal is to learn how to make everything I do accessible. I think it is great that technology is making sure it has adaptability. There are some great tools and resources to help make sure I am at least getting close to making accessible sites. If you have comments on how I can improve, please do.
